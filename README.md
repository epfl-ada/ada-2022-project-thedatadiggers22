# Digital propagation of the COVID-19 pandemic

## Abstract 
<p align="justify">
It is reasonable to assume that Wikipedia searches reflect interest as users must actively want to know more about a subject to search it on Wikipedia. Using this hypothesis, we seek to assess the “digital” propagation of the COVID-19 pandemic by looking at the pageview statistics of COVID-related pages across different languages and comparing this to the geographical propagation of the virus. We can thus link the “mental” and physical presence of the virus across countries and analyse how it impacted measures taken by the governments and the mobility of the populations.  Are there patterns? Does mental presence link to a better handling of the pandemic? In a second stage, we will make an in-depth analysis of a select few countries an <strong>[to finish]</strong>.

## Research quesions

1. How did the physical propagation of the COVID-19 pandemic affect the interest of people about COVID-19 measured using Wikipedia pageviews of articles related to COVID-19?
2. Did the different lockdowns and modified mobility impacted the interest of populations toward COVID-19?
3. Did trust towards politics of the country have an impact on the evolution of the number of cases/deaths and the mobility? Does people less confident about their politics will look more or less to covid pages?

We are using ZenHub to create and track our issues effectively. As this project is about continous exploration, we'll be using the Kanban methodology. We'll discuss, prioritize, distribute and reassess the issues during our weekly meetings.
